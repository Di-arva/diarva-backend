You’ve already built a **very strong foundation** — let’s see where we stand.

# 🔜 WHAT’S LEFT (MAJOR FEATURES AHEAD)

## ✅ Phase 4 (Clinic side) – **We are mid-way**

### ✅ Done:

* Create task ✅
* List tasks ✅
* Get task by ID ✅

### 🚧 Still to do:

* **Update task** (PATCH /clinic/tasks/:id)
* **Delete/cancel task** (DELETE or PATCH status=cancelled)
* Optional: Draft vs publish logic
* Show applications count updates

---

## ⏭ Phase 5 – Assistant Side (Job Discovery & Applications)

* Browse available tasks (matching location, requirements)
* View task details
* Apply to task (`POST /applications`)
* Prevent duplicate applications
* Track application status

---

## ⏭ Phase 6 – Application Management (Clinic + Assistant)

Clinic can:

* View all applications per task
* Accept / reject an assistant
* Auto-increase applications_count on apply

Assistant can:

* Withdraw application
* See application status

---

## ⏭ Phase 7 – Assignment & Work Tracking

* Once application accepted → Task moves to `assigned`

* Send email/SMS to assistant

* Assistant accepts assignment → `in_progress`

* Track:

  * started_at
  * completed_at
  * no_show, cancel

* Create WorkHistory record after complete

* Store hours worked, rates, final amount

---

## ⏭ Phase 8 – Payment (Basic)

* Payment terms (already set on task)
* Mark task as paid / unpaid / pending
* (Later: integration with Stripe/PayPal/bank transfer)
* Generate invoice / receipt (optional)

---

## ⏭ Phase 9 – Ratings & Feedback

* Clinic rates assistant
